COSC 3P98 Assignment #1

Instructions for compiling and running code.

Note: Program written for and tested on linux. May not run on Windows, so please test on Linux. I tested it on a 
lab machine so it should work fine in the linux enviornment of the lab machines.

Image Filter:
1. cd into image_filter directory
2. Run Makefile with command "make", should compile code
3. Run image_filter with command "./filter"
4. All functions are available in a menu accessed by a right mouse button click on the window. A subset of these 
functions are also available as keyboard commands, these are listed in the terminal when the program is run.
5. To run program using a different image file, just rename the image 'img.tif'

Screen Saver:
1. cd into screen_saver directory
2. Run Makefile with command "make", should compile code
3. Run screen_saver with command "./saver"
4. All functions are available in a menu accessed by a right mouse button click on the window. A subset of these 
functions are also available as keyboard commands, these are listed in the terminal when the program is run.
Note: Shape tends to look distorted when in fullscreen mode, and look normal in a windowed view. 
So included the function to change between fullscreen and windowed.
